<h3>Friend Finder - U of A bootcamp week 13 assignment.<h3>

This app uses Express.js and body-parser to POST and GET information from a data set.

In the application, the user enters a name and a link to a photo. They then answer a set of ten questions and the app compares their answers to the answers of the stored 'friends' and lets the user know who their most compatible friend is.
